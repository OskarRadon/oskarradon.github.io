# Oskar Zone
Portfolio Website 2020

The site is a single-column scroll with images that are responsive-ly loaded in using `srcset` and `sizes` to hopefully reduce page load time. Horizontal images are `width: 100%`, while vertical images like posters are left aligned with `max width: 60%` so they don't take up too much visual real estate on scroll.

The type is set in Alte Haas Grotesk, all in one size, with 8 media queries that affect the `font-size` and `line-height`. Typographic hierarchy is established using bold text, or a dark grey color. Instead of having an "About" page I opted to display a short "about me" text, my education history, and selected clients in the header with a toggle button to show or hide some of the information. I did this because I wanted to prioritize big images of the work while still giving the user a good idea of who I am.
